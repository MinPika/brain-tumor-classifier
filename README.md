### Using the Python API

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import cv2

# Load model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model.keras')

# Preprocess image
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img_array = np.array(img)
    
    # Convert to grayscale
    if len(img_array.shape) == 3:
        img_array = cv2.cvtColor(img_array, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    
    # Resize to 168x168
    img_resized = cv2.resize(img_array, (168, 168))
    
    # Normalize
    img_normalized = img_resized / 255.0
    
    # Add dimensions
    img_final = np.expand_dims(img_normalized, axis=-1)
    img_final = np.expand_dims(img_final, axis=0)
    
    return img_final

# Make prediction
image_path = 'path/to/mri/scan.jpg'
preprocessed = preprocess_image(image_path)
prediction = model.predict(preprocessed)

# Get results
class_names = ['Glioma', 'Meningioma', 'Notumor', 'Pituitary']
predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(prediction[0])]
confidence = np.max(prediction[0]) * 100

print(f"Prediction: {predicted_class}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.2f}%")
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Improved CNN Design

Our optimized architecture achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters:

```
Input Layer: 168 × 168 × 1 (Grayscale)
    ↓
Convolutional Block 1:
    - Conv2D: 64 filters, 5×5 kernel, ReLU
    - MaxPooling2D: 3×3 pool size
    Output: 54 × 54 × 64
    ↓
Convolutional Block 2:
    - Conv2D: 64 filters, 5×5 kernel, ReLU
    - MaxPooling2D: 3×3 pool size
    Output: 16 × 16 × 64
    ↓
Convolutional Block 3:
    - Conv2D: 128 filters, 4×4 kernel, ReLU
    - MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pool size
    Output: 6 × 6 × 128
    ↓
Convolutional Block 4:
    - Conv2D: 128 filters, 4×4 kernel, ReLU
    - MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pool size
    Output: 1 × 1 × 128
    ↓
Fully Connected Layers:
    - Flatten: 128 features
    - Dense: 512 units, ReLU, Dropout (0.25)
    - Dense: 256 units, ReLU, Dropout (0.20)
    - Dense: 4 units, Softmax (Output)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Grayscale Input:** Reduced complexity by 3× compared to RGB
2. **Larger Kernels:** 5×5 and 4×4 kernels capture coarse tumor morphology better than standard 3×3
3. **Aggressive Pooling:** 3×3 initial pooling rapidly reduces spatial dimensions
4. **Lightweight Design:** 47.7× fewer parameters than baseline model
5. **Strategic Dropout:** Minimal dropout (0.25, 0.20) prevents overfitting without sacrificing performance

## 📈 Results & Analysis

### Training Performance

#### Improved CNN Training Curves
- **Final Training Accuracy:** 99.9%
- **Final Validation Accuracy:** 98.93%
- **Final Training Loss:** 0.0013
- **Convergence:** Achieved 90% accuracy by epoch 10

#### Comparison with Baseline

| Metric | Baseline CNN | Improved CNN | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Test Accuracy | 98.55% | **99.31%** | +0.76 pp |
| Parameters | 27.0M | **565K** | 47.7× smaller |
| Model Size | 103 MB | **2.16 MB** | 47.7× smaller |
| Training Time/Epoch | 63s | **9s** | 7× faster |
| Total Errors | 19 | **9** | 52.6% reduction |

### Error Analysis

**Misclassification Breakdown (9 total errors):**
- Glioma → Meningioma: 6 cases
- Meningioma → Glioma: 5 cases
- Meningioma → Pituitary: 2 cases
- Pituitary → Meningioma: 1 case
- No Tumor: 0 errors (perfect classification)

**Key Insights:**
- Most errors occur between Glioma and Meningioma (visually similar tumors)
- No false positives for healthy brains (critical for avoiding unnecessary procedures)
- All misclassifications are between tumor types (no tumor-to-healthy errors)

### Clinical Relevance

- **Sensitivity:** 99.31% (correctly identifies tumors)
- **Specificity:** 100% for No Tumor class (avoids false alarms)
- **Potential Impact:** Reducing misclassifications from 19→9 per 1,311 cases could save lives through earlier detection
